# JSON vs XML: How APIs Share Data
A beginner-friendly comparison of two common data formats used in APIs.

## Introduction
When two applications interact through an API, they require a common language to exchange information. Most APIs use either **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) or **XML** (eXtensible Markup Language) to exchange data. 
This guide breaks down what each format looks like, how they differ, and why developers choose one over the other. 

## Quick Refresher: What is an API 
- An **API (Application Programming Interface)** allows software systems to communicate with each other.  
- Think of it like a restaurant menu: you (the client) order a dish (request), and the kitchen (server) sends it back (response).  
- JSON and XML are simply two ways the server can describe what is on the plate.
## Example: A Simple API Response 
Imagine you ask a Book API for details about "The Great Gatsby". 
JSON's response should be:

```json
{
  "title": "The Great Gatsby",
  "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
  "year": 1925
}
```
And hereâ€™s the same data in XML:
```
<book>
    <title>The Great Gatsby</title>
    <author>F. Scott Fitzgerald</author>
    <year>1925</year>
</book>
```
## JSON vs XML: Key Differences
```
|Feature              |JSON                               |XML                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Format              | Lightweight, uses '{}' and '[]'   | Tag based with '<tag>' structure                   |
| Readability         | Easier for humans to read         | More verbose, extra closing tags                   |
| Data Types          | Supports numbers, booleans, null  | Everything is text unless parsed                   |
| Use in APIs         | Most modern APIs prefer JSON      | Older APIs or enterprise systems may still use XML |
```
## When to Use Each Format
- **JSON** is ideal for modern web and mobile applications because it's fast, easy to read, and integrates well with JavaScript.  
- **XML** is sometimes used in older systems, banking, or document-based data where metadata and strict validation are important.
## Conclusion
Both JSON and XML are ways for APIs to share data, but JSON has become the go-to choice for most developers due to its simplicity and speed.  

Understanding both formats will help you read and interpret API responses, making it easier to work with different systems in the future.
